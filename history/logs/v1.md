## JHP 1.5.0 (9 Jan 2021)

- First actually working version of JHP :sweat_smile:
    - feat: Many tiny bug fixes and feature tweaks, mostly revolving around removing bloated features and fixing scoping.
    - fix(`$include`): Now works properly, echoing the included file's content only when not assigned to a variable.
    - !feat(`$default`): In hindsight this feature was unnecessary and has been removed; now that we handle variable assignment properly.

### JHP 1.0.0 (6 Jan 2021)
