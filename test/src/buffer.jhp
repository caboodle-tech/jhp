<h1>Output Buffering</h1>

<p>
    This page demonstrates the use of <code>$obOpen</code>, <code>$obClose</code>, and <code>$echo</code> functions for content capturing and rendering. The <code>$obOpen</code> function initiates content capture at the start of the page, while <code>$obClose</code> stops the capture at the end. The <code>$echo</code> function then outputs the captured content, allowing for flexible content management and rendering.
