### JHP 3.1.0 (12 Dec 2025)

We have upgraded the Simple HTML Parser to the standalone package `@caboodle-tech/simple-html-parser`. This means that JHP no longer includes its own copy of the
Simple HTML Parser code. This change helps to reduce duplication and ensures that JHP always uses the latest version of the Simple HTML Parser.

### JHP 3.0.0 (15 Oct 2025)

We now include the pre and post processor scripts in the main JHP package. This means you no longer
need to include them separately yourself. By default they will be included automatically when you
get a new instance of JHP. If you do not want this behavior, you can pass
`{ reregisterJhpProcessors: false }` in the JHP constructor options object.
