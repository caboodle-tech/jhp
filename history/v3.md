### JHP 3.0.0 (15 Oct 2025)

We now include the pre and post processor scripts in the main JHP package. This means you no longer
need to include them separately yourself. By default they will be included automatically when you
get a new instance of JHP. If you do not want this behavior, you can pass
`{ reregisterJhpProcessors: false }` in the JHP constructor options object.
