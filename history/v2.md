### JHP 2.3.2 (20 Mar 2025)

New feature add to JHP:
- feat(`process`): Now allows you to pass in `options.context` which as variables or functions that should exist in the global scope of JHP file being processed.

Major bugfixes in `SimpleHtmlParser.parse` method:
- Incorrectly handled `//` as comments instead of URL parts in script blocks; was breaking `ws://` code on a testing site.
- Check for `0` attributes on the script tag was missing, causing all script tags to be processed unnecessarily.

### JHP 2.3.1 (17 Mar 2025)

Minor bugfix in the `SimpleHtmlParser.parse` method. Attributes were not being parsed correctly when the attribute value contained a `-` character.

### JHP 2.3.0 (13 Mar 2025)

Bugfix and optimization of the `#preprocessScriptBlock` method.
- fix(`#preprocessScriptBlock`): Fixed a bug where previously declared variables were not being recognized in the current include scope and therefore were not being replaced with their new values.
- feat(`#preprocessScriptBlock`): Worked with Claude AI to optimize this method into a single-pass transformation.

### JHP 2.2.0 (10 Mar 2025)

Minor updates to the engine:
- feat(`registerDollarProperty`): Added the ability to register custom properties on the `$` object.
- feat(`buffers`): Changed `#htmlOutputBuffer` and `#currentBuffer` to use `Array<string>` instead of `string` to improve performance by reducing constant string concatenation.

### JHP 2.1.0 (7 Mar 2025)

Major rewrite of the engine and how it handles parsing:
- !feat(`SimpleHtmlParser`): Uses a custom parser to reduce the number of dependencies, improve performance, and reduce the need for regex.
- !feat(`if-elseif-else-end`): Added the ability to use `if`, `elseif`, and `else` conditional blocks to control the output of the JHP engine.
- !feat: Added methods to allow registering pre and post processing functions.
- feat: `process` method now accepts a string representing code to process or a file path.
- fix(`#include`): Removed unnecessary code; return was not needed because results are being buffered.
- feat: Added a `options` object to control the behavior of the parser and the JHP engine in general.
- feat: Added the ability to change the default tag(s) used to denote a JHP block of code.
- fix: Various bug fixes and improvements to the engine.
