<blockquote>
<script>
    let today = new Date();
    let day = today.getDate();
    $echo(today);
    $if(day % 3 === 0);
</script>

<p>
    Today is divisible by 3.
</p>

<script>
    $elseif(day % 3 === 1);
</script>

<p>
    Today leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.
</p>

<script>
    $else();
</script>

<p>
