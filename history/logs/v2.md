### JHP 2.0.0 (4 Mar 2025)

- Major rewrite of the engine and how it handles parsing:
    - !feat(`SimpleHtmlParser`): Uses a custom parser to reduce the number of dependencies, improve performance, and reduce the need for regex.
    - !feat: Added methods to allow registering pre and post processing functions.
    - fix(`#include`): Removed unnecessary code; return was not needed because results are being buffered.
