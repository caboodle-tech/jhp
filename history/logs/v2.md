### JHP 2.1.0 (7 Mar 2025)

- Major rewrite of the engine and how it handles parsing:
    - !feat(`SimpleHtmlParser`): Uses a custom parser to reduce the number of dependencies, improve performance, and reduce the need for regex.
    - !feat(`if-elseif-else-end`): Added the ability to use `if`, `elseif`, and `else` conditional blocks to control the output of the JHP engine.
    - !feat: Added methods to allow registering pre and post processing functions.
    - feat: `process` method now accepts a string representing code to process or a file path.
    - fix(`#include`): Removed unnecessary code; return was not needed because results are being buffered.
    - feat: Added a `options` object to control the behavior of the parser and the JHP engine in general.
    - feat: Added the ability to change the default tag(s) used to denote a JHP block of code.
    - fix: Various bug fixes and improvements to the engine.
